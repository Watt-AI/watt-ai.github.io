The Evolution of Music and AI Technology
========================================

Emergent technologies have shaped the world of music since its
conception. From the advent of recordings, to an electronic revolution
of music, and now to AI technology, you can see how the role of
technology in the artistic process is continually growing. Right now,
many current breakthroughs that are pushing boundaries in the music
world have been spurred by decades of research and discovery in AI
technology. In this post, we will track the evolution of AI music
methods to see how this technology is making new sounds, melodies,
compositions, and even recreating the human voice.

<br/><br/> In particular, the role of artificial intelligence in both
understanding and creating music has significantly grown since the
1950s. From rudimentary algorithms to a multi-faceted industry with
intelligent-music systems, the progressive growth in AI music
intelligence displays a technical expansion of AI methodologies.

*Timeline of the 3 Major Phases of Music AI Growth*

Early Stages (1950s - 1970s)
----------------------------

The first attempts at computer-generated music appeared in the 1950s
with a focus on algorithmic music creation. The advent of
computer-generated music by pioneers like Alan Turing with the
Manchester Mark II computer opened up multiple possibilities for
research into music intelligence where computational systems could
recognize, create, and analyze music.

<p align="center">

</p>
<br/><br/> Specifically, early experiments focused on algorithmic
composition (a computer using formal sets of rules to create music). In
1957, we see the first work composed solely by artificial intelligence —
Illiac Suite for String Quartet. <br/><br/>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">

Museum</i>
<p>
<br/><br/> Through the use of mathematical models and algorithms,
Lejaren Hiller (an American composer) and Leonard Isaacson (an American
composer and mathematician) made Illiac Suite, the first original piece
composed by a computer. To achieve this feat, they used a Monte Carlo
algorithm which generated random numbers that correspond to certain
musical features like pitch or rhythm. Using a set of restrictions,
these random features were limited to elements that would be musically
‘legal’ as defined by traditional musical theory rules, statistical
probabilities (like Markov Chains), and the imagination of the two
composers. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<i>The First Movement of Illiac Suite. Click the image to hear the

<br/><br/>

Another innovator in this field was Iannis Xenakis, a composer and
engineer, who used stochastic probabilities to aid in his music
creation. A stochastic process is a mechanism with random probability
distributions that cannot be predicted but can be analyzed
statistically. In the early 60s, he utilized computers and the FORTRAN
language to interweave multiple probability functions to determine
overall structure and other parameters (like pitch and dynamics) of a
composition.
<br/><br/>

</p>
<p align="center"> 
<i>Iannis Xenakis - Photo from Paris Autumn Festival</i>
</p>
<br/><br/> Xenakis modeled his music as if he was modeling a science
experiment. Each instrument was like a molecule and would undergo its
own stochastic, random process to determine its behavior (the frequency
of pitch and velocity of certain notes).

*A mathematical representation of Pithoprakta, an early work by
Xenakis. He models different sound spaces though these Glissandi (the
glide from one pitch to another) as graphs of straight lines (time on
the horizontal axis, pitch on the vertical), where different slopes
correspond to different “sound spaces.” Image by Iannis Xenakis.*

His work introduced new methods for sound creation, but also served as
an early example of AI working as a supplementary analysis tool rather
than just a compositional tool. The way Xenakis created his melodies and
orchestration for different instruments drew inspiration from the sounds
spaces modeled by the stochastic process.

autonomous creators and as supplementary guides continues today as we
can see intelligent sound systems that are specialized to generate
original pieces like the Illiac Suite or to break down the science of
the sound like Xenakis’s stochastic processes.

Transitional Period — Generative Modeling (1980s - 1990s)
---------------------------------------------------------

In the decades leading up to the modern era of music, the focus moved
from simpler, algorithmic generation to generative modeling. Otto Laske,
a prominent researcher in the field of Sonology, describes this change
as the difference between a *musical robot* and *musical intelligence*.

A musical robot is more akin to the early experiments in the 50s and 60s
— it can recognize patterns, has a grammar for music, and has a general
sense of problem-solving, but it achieves its goals with fairly direct
and blunt methods. On the other hand, musical intelligence replaces the
robot’s brute-force searching approach with a knowledge-based
understanding system with its own awareness of how musical elements may
function.

<p align="center">

</p>
<br/><br/>

This trend towards AI systems building their own self-sufficient
understanding of musical elements was the basis for the higher-level
music intelligence we see today.

In the 1980s, David Cope (a composer and professor of music) with his
Experiments in Music Intelligence (EMI) was a major believer that the
scope of computer composition could include a deeper understanding of
music through his 3 basic methods:

-   (1) deconstruction (analysis and separation into parts)
-   (2) signatures (commonalities — retaining that which signifies
        style)
-   (3) compatibility (recombinancy — recombining musical elements into
        new works)

His work revolved around this idea of recombinancy where elements from
previous works are combined and modified to create new pieces of music.
Some of the greatest composers of all time played with recombinancy
(either consciously or unconsciously) as they reshaped existing
ideas/styles into their own work. In EMI, David Cope wanted to replicate
this behavior through the use of computers and their computational
ability.

in Music Intelligence.</i>
</p>
<br/>

Cope’s work was the foundation for many current AI models on the market
right now. First music and its attributes are encoded into databases,
then the collection of the recombinant segments is extracted using
certain identifiers and pattern matching systems. From there, musical
segments are categorized and reconstructed in a logical, musical order
using augmented transition networks until new music output is produced.
This type of ‘regenerative’ construction of music is reminiscent of many
of the current neural networks that compose music today.

<i>Robert Rowe’s book explores technology in the process of music

</p>
<br/><br/>

Other developments in this period continued to explore the boundaries of
computational creativity. For example, Robert Rowe created a system
where a machine can infer meter, tempo, and note lengths while someone
is playing freely on a keyboard. Also in 1995, Imagination Engines’
trained a neural network with popular melodies by triggering
reinforcement learning leading to the generation of over 10,000 new
musical choruses. Reinforcement learning involves training a neural
network to achieve a goal by rewarding/punishing the model based on the
decisions it makes reach a specified goal.

Current Period (2000s - Present)
--------------------------------

In the current era of music AI technology, the roots of generative
modeling and algorithmic composition have dynamically spread into
higher-level research and even into the music industry. With the use of
more experimental algorithms and deeper neural networks, the role of AI
music intelligence in the creative process has grown significantly.

### Intelligent Composition with Iamus

In 2010, Melomics’ Iamus project was the first computer to compose
classical music in its own style. Iamus is a computer cluster that
utilizes evolutionary algorithms to compose its musical fragments,
showing some divergence from Cope’s generative modeling based upon
previous music.

<p align="center">

[Materia](http://esmateria.com/2012/07/14/iamus-la-maquina-que-quiere-ser-todos-los-compositore/)*

Like the process of natural selection, a randomly generated piece of
music is mutated (changed pitch, dynamics, etc) and analyzed by a set of
rules to see if it follows established rules by music theory or the
genre. Eventually, this evolution allows a random input fragment to
develop into hundreds of compositions that follow real music criteria
after only a couple of minutes.

### Music Analysis with Magenta

Magenta is a project started by Google Brain which uses machine learning
as a tool to enhance the creative process. They have created a number of
applications that display some of the capabilities of music intelligence
such as transcribing audio using neural networks or blending musical
scores with what are called latent space models. However, we can see the
depth of Magenta’s music analysis through their experiments with
MusicVAE.

MusicVAE is a machine learning model that can blend together musical
scores to compose new pieces. They achieve this through the use of a
latent space model, which is where higher-dimensional dataset variation
is transcribed into a more understandable mathematical language. This is
achieved by the use of an autoencoder which uses a dataset of melodies
and compresses (encodes) each example into a vector representation, then
reshapes this vector into the same melody (decoding).

<p align="center">

</p>

After learning how to compress and decompress multiple inputs, the
autoencoder learns the qualities that are similar throughout the whole
dataset. MusicVAE is founded on this principle but adds hierarchical
structures to the process to produce a long-term structure.

From this framework, MusicVAE is able to construct multiple applications
for making interpolations, drum patterns, and entirely new melodic loops
based on an input of your music.

### Sound Synthesis with NSynth

While most early research focuses on the act of composition, current
research has expanded to include machine learning in the realm of sound
synthesis. Magenta’s NSynth (Neural Synthesizer) utilizes neural
networks to make sounds at the level of individual samples rather than
from oscillators/wavetables like traditional synthesizers. This approach
allows for more artistic control over timbre (the distinct character of
a sound) to further assist in the creative process.

<i>Hector Plimmer experimenting with the NSynth Super instrument. Click

NSynth uses what is known as a Wave-Net style autoencoder on a dataset
of 300,000 musical notes from roughly 1,000 instruments. This unique
dataset allows for the factorization of a musical sound into notes and
other qualities based on this relationship based on the total
probability theorem.

</p>

*NSynth’s encoding process can create multiple sounds from two inputs.
Image by Magneta*

The goal of the autoencoder is to model the timbre (*P(audio | note)* in
the equation) of a sound into latent space. NSynth employs a temporal
encoder with mathematical algorithms known as convolutions. After 30
layers of these convolutions, two audio inputs are compressed into 16
dimensions corresponding to 16 temporal features of the sound. Next,
this compressed data is upsampled and interpolated to make new
embeddings (mathematical representations of the sound). The final step
synthesizes a wealth of new sounds that hold qualities from both inputs
by decoding these embeddings.

### Generative Modeling with Jukebox

Most attempts at autonomous music generation tend to generate music
symbolically, usually through a piano roll or MIDI which serve as types
of language that can describe sounds/sequences. OpenAI’s Jukebox takes
generative modeling to a higher level by modeling music and the human
voice directly as raw audio. With their approach, Jukebox can generate
melody, compositions, timbre, and even rudimentary singing in a variety
of genres and styles. To tackle the depth of the semantic information of
raw audio, they use specialized encoders and neural networks.

<p align="center">  
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/2020-07-23-Evolution_Music_AI/jukebox.png?raw=true" alt="Image">
</p>

<p align ="center">
<i>Image by OpenAI<i>
</p>
<br/>

Jukebox compresses their audio into a latent space using something known
as VQ-VAE encoders. The overall system starts with using convolutional
neural networks to encode the audio and then finding patterns from these
encodings. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is an algorithm that can
take an input image and mathematically represent its unique features
through matrices of multiple dimensions. CNNs can be used on audio by
applying them to a visual representation of an audio sample (such as a
spectrogram). Follow this link for a more in-depth explanation of CNNs:
<https://pathmind.com/wiki/convolutional-network#work>

To combat loss of musical data in this encoding process, Jukebox also
employs a combination of loss functions and upsamplers to retain
information. These patterns are then decoded into a novel audio using
more CNNs.

<p align="center">  
<img width="650" height="250" src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/2020-07-23-Evolution_Music_AI/jukebox_levels.png?raw=true" alt="Image">
</p>

*3 separate VQ-VAE models at different temporal resolution. Image by
OpenAI*

However, Jukebox differs from other models with the nature of VQ-VAE as
it is essentially an autoencoder with a something called a
‘discretization bottleneck’ which means that it retains different
amounts of musical information at three independent reconstruction
levels (each level encodes a different amount of information). This use
of separate encoders, rather than a hierarchical system allows their
model to better handle the raw audio latent space as audio can be
reconstructed from any of the three layers.

<p align="center">

Jukebox’s method of separate autoencoders. Third row is without the
spectral loss function. Fourth row is a hierarchical VQ-VAE. Fifth row

After learning from a dataset of 1.2 million songs, Jukebox shows a step
forward in generative modeling of music through the use of audio. With
musical coherence, traditional song patterns, solo performances, and the
replication of the human voice appearing in the generated songs, we can
clearly see the progress from early ideas of recombinancy or algorithmic
composition.

### Other Breakthroughs

The continual growth of music intelligence has led to this technology
moving into numerous more commercial applications. For instance, LANDR
utilizes deep learning algorithms for automated audio mastering.
Additionally, many products have utilized combinations of neural
networks and reinforcement learning algorithms to release commercial
songs such as an album by Taryn Southern (co-produced by Amper Music)
and the *Hello World* album (made with Sony’s Flow Machines with
artists). As these algorithms and neural networks grow, we will see more
AI-assisted music in mainstream settings in the near future.

As AI technology has become more refined from the pioneering ideas of
researchers like Hiller/Isaacson and Cope, its prevalence in the music
industry has exponentially grown. Commercial applications are assisting
artists in their creative process or even for soundtracks and background
music, yet the role of the human mind in the artistic process is still
necessary for the true emotional and creative depth of original music.

As the accessibility and capabilities of AI technology grow, they will
undoubtedly change the music industry. However, instead of surrendering
to this inevitable change, musicians can learn and adapt their creative
processes to use AI music intelligence as another step in the evolution
of their creative arts.
